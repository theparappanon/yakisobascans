Yep, we moved sites again.

Because yes, I'm very much tired of Wordpress now.

Yes, this means I cannot log into the BearBlog anymore, blame a "forgotten password" chain, since I haven't really done anything
particularly bad.

But unlike Bearblog, this site doesn't require me to add yet another password to my list - since I already am hosting [a couple](https://hoppingtopping.com/) [other sites](httops://parappa.hoppingtopping.com) in the same VPS this one is hosted in, I can just update all
of these at the same time if I ever need to.

But with all of that regardless, you can now find all of our previous releases in [this big MediaFire link](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/nxuc6gdapigpi/All_YakisobaScans_Releases_Ever).

[Our previous website](https://yakisoba.mangadex.com/) hasn't gone away either, and it'll likely stay around for historical purposes even after I copy all the previous releases, as well as single-image translations
and other KMB/Kaduho related text translations on here.

-Yakisoba, who can't wait to post her first actual release on this site.
